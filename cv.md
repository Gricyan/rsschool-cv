## Summary:

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|  Briefly about myself... |
| :---        |    :----  |
|   ![](./assets/images/my-photo.jpg)   | I was interested in information technologies when I was in high school, and I even attended a programming class. We learned how to create simple games in Pascal. Oh yeah, I'm such an old one )). But at university, my choice fell on an jurisprudence and I worked in court for several years. There I learnt these skills well: **punctuality**, **meticulousness** and **stress tolerance**. Meanwhile, creating things has always fascinated me, and about six years ago I made my first website for the company I was employed. The process involved me so much that I could sit for hours and hours figuring out how it worked. Later, when I moved to Wasraw, **I finished a post-secondary school studying web development**. Currently I have a few pet projects. But it's still like a hobby of mine. |
