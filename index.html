        <p>My first website I made about seven years ago, when the frontend was not yet as hyped as it is now. Since
          then web development is my fascination and part time work.</p>
        <p>Despite the fact that I studied law at university and worked as a judge's assistant for several years,
          this experience gave me valuable skills such as <span class="highlighted-text">punctuality</span>, <span
            class="highlighted-text">thoroughness</span> and <span class="highlighted-text">stress tolerance</span>.
        </p>
        <p>Three years ago I moved to Warsaw and studied <span class="highlighted-text">networking</span> and <span
            class="highlighted-text">web development</span> here.</p>
        <p>I am currently taking a frontend course at the RS School.</p>
